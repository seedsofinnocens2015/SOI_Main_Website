Let's separate fact from fiction with evidence-based information.</p><h3>Myth 1: Infertility is Always a Woman's Problem</h3><p><strong>Fact:</strong> Infertility affects both men and women equally. About one-third of infertility cases are due to female factors, one-third due to male factors, and one-third due to combined factors or unknown causes.</p><h3>Myth 2: You Can't Get Pregnant After 35</h3><p><strong>Fact:</strong> While fertility declines with age, many women successfully conceive after 35. However, it may take longer and the risk of complications increases. Early consultation with a fertility specialist is recommended.</p><h3>Myth 3: Stress Causes Infertility</h3><p><strong>Fact:</strong> While stress can affect your overall health and may impact fertility indirectly, it's not a direct cause of infertility. However, managing stress is still important for your well-being.</p><h3>Myth 4: IVF Always Results in Multiple Births</h3><p><strong>Fact:</strong> Modern IVF practices focus on single embryo transfer to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies. The number of embryos transferred is carefully considered based on individual circumstances.</p><h3>Myth 5: Fertility Treatments Are Always Expensive</h3><p><strong>Fact:</strong> While some treatments can be costly, there are various options available at different price points. Many clinics offer payment plans, and some treatments may be covered by insurance.</p><h3>Myth 6: You Need to Have Sex Every Day to Conceive</h3><p><strong>Fact:</strong> Having sex every other day during your fertile window is typically sufficient. Daily intercourse may actually reduce sperm count.</p><h3>Myth 7: Birth Control Pills Cause Infertility</h3><p><strong>Fact:</strong> Birth control pills do not cause long-term infertility. Fertility typically returns within a few months after stopping the pill.</p><p>At Seeds of Innocens, we believe in providing accurate, evidence-based information to help you make informed decisions about your fertility journey.</p>",
