## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Static Export Limitation**: Since your Next.js app uses static export (`output: 'export'`), the redirect pages use Next.js `redirect()` function which works during build time. For production, these will be static HTML pages that redirect.

2. **Header Menu**: All routes are now accessible through the header menu. The menu structure has been updated to match your old website's organization.

3. **Content Placeholders**: All new pages have basic content structure. You need to add your actual content from the old website.

4. **Images**: Most pages are using placeholder images. Replace these with actual images from your old website or create new ones.

5. **Testing**: After adding content, thoroughly test all pages and redirects to ensure everything works correctly.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Review all new pages and add content
2. Replace placeholder images with actual images
3. Test all redirects
4. Update any internal links in content
5. Add SEO meta tags
6. Test on mobile devices
7. Verify header menu functionality
8. Check all URLs are accessible
